version: 5.5.0
description: GKN-Phantom — production-grade automated penetration testing and security validation skill. v5.5 rebuilds the multi-pattern matching hot paths on a Trie/Aho-Corasick engine (pattern_matcher.py): tech fingerprinting, WAF detection, JS secret/sink scanning, DB error fingerprinting, and HTML tech detection now run one AC pass per response and execute only the regexes whose required literals are present — provably identical results, 3-15x faster on large bodies. v5.3 completes the Quick Combat impact chain: quick detect (nuclei + built-in probes) → content-aware severity escalation (v5.2) → deep-dive adapters proving impact from exposed content (Actuator/GraphQL/Swagger, v5.3 C1) → parameter discovery with bounded error-based SQLi/SSTI probing (v5.3 C2) → auto PoC generation → auto exploit generation → bundled combat report. Retains v5 capabilities including interactive browser agent (Playwright), HTML/PDF visualization reports, YAML rule configuration with hot-reload, covering 38 vulnerability types, 25+ WAF fingerprints, and 20+ attack chain patterns across 35 modules. Trigger phrases include penetration test, pentest, security audit, vulnerability scan, security validation, and their Chinese equivalents.

# GKN-Phantom — Penetration Testing Skill

## Overview

Execute automated, authorized penetration testing and security validation in
staging / dev / internal / lab environments. v5.1 introduces **Quick Combat Mode**
(`scripts/quick_combat.py`): a streamlined pipeline that runs a fast nuclei scan
(with scope limits preventing timeout), 7 built-in quick probes, then auto-
generates PoCs (curl/Python/HAR) and exploit scripts (functional Python) —
bundling everything into a timestamped combat report with HTML index. This
replaces the elaborate tiered detection plan approach with a practical
detect → PoC → exploit workflow, informed by real combat feedback. v5.4 adds
five combat layers on top: a domestic OA/component probe library (泛微/致远/
通达/用友/禅道/JeecgBoot/若依/...), a full-site katana crawl feeding parameter
probes, JS bundle mining with hidden-endpoint chaining, a real out-of-band
channel (interactsh/ceye/dnslog) that validates blind SSRF via callback, and
a cross-run combat memory that marks `[已提交]/[重复]` findings to avoid SRC
duplicate submissions. v5.5 adds a **pattern matching engine**
(`scripts/pattern_matcher.py`): the multi-literal matching hot paths —
technology fingerprinting, WAF detection, JS secret/sink scanning, DB error
fingerprinting, HTML tech detection — are now evaluated through a
Trie/Aho-Corasick gate that reads each response once and runs only the
regexes whose required literals are actually present. Results are provably
identical to the previous per-pattern scans (property-tested against naive
iteration); large bodies scan 3-15x faster and small bodies automatically
keep the naive path.

The skill still supports the full state-machine pipeline for deep audits:
scope check → pre-flight → reconnaissance → auth setup → active testing →
validation → attack path analysis → report generation. 38 vulnerability types
across 4 severity tiers, 25+ WAF fingerprints, and 20+ attack chain patterns.
Every action passes through a Scope Guard, Risk Gate, and Rate Limiter; every
finding carries reproducible evidence. A hard **Reproducibility Gate**
(see below) guarantees that only live-replayed, control-compared findings
reach the report — theoretical or assumed vulnerabilities are quarantined
as `unverified_leads` and never reported as vulnerabilities.

> **Safety Disclaimer**: This skill is restricted to authorized security
> testing, internal security audits, and staging/dev/lab environment
> verification ONLY. It MUST NOT be used against unauthorized systems, real
> internet targets, or for data theft / destruction. See
> `references/safety_policy.md`.

## System Dependencies (Linux / Kali / CentOS)

GKN-Phantom scripts require **Python 3.10+** (standard library only —
no pip packages). The agent's `runShell` tool delegates to OS-level
utilities for recon. Ensure the following are in `PATH` before use:

### Required

| Package | Required by | Kali (apt) | CentOS / RHEL (yum/dnf) |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| `python3` (≥3.10) | all scripts | `python3` (pre-installed) | `dnf install python3` |
| `nmap` | ACTIVE_RECON port scanning | `nmap` (pre-installed) | `dnf install nmap` |

### Optional — Automated Detection & Graceful Fallback

GKN-Phantom v4.0 auto-detects these tools and uses them when available,
falling back to pure-Python built-in implementations when absent.
Installing them unlocks deeper scanning capabilities:

| Package | Unlocks | Kali (apt) | Manual Install |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| `nuclei` | Template-based CVE scanning (nuclei_runner.py) | `apt install nuclei` | `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest` |
| `subfinder` | Active subdomain brute-force | `apt install subfinder` | `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest` |
| `httpx` | Live host probing + tech stack fingerprinting | `apt install httpx` | `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest` |
| `ffuf` | High-speed directory fuzzing | `apt install ffuf` | `go install github.com/ffuf/ffuf/v2@latest` |
| `amass` | Deep DNS/subdomain enumeration | `apt install amass` | `go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master` |
| `katana` | JS crawling & endpoint discovery | `apt install katana` | `go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest` |
| `naabu` | Fast port scanning (nmap alternative) | `apt install naabu` | `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu@latest` |

For minimal CentOS / Docker environments, also ensure `ca-certificates`
is installed for TLS validation during HTTP fingerprinting.

**Note:** All optional tools have pure-Python fallbacks in the v4.0
modules. `passive_recon.py` handles subdomain discovery via crt.sh/DNS;
`directory_fuzzer.py` provides rate-limited built-in fuzzing;
`tech_fingerprint.py` does header/body-based detection without httpx;
`nuclei_runner.py` generates a manual scanning guide when nuclei is absent.

## When To Use This Skill

Use this skill when ANY of the following apply:

- A user requests a penetration test, security audit, or vulnerability scan of
  an asset they are explicitly authorized to test.
- A CI/CD pipeline needs security validation with SARIF-like JSON output.
- A security engineer wants reproducible, evidence-backed findings with attack
  path analysis.
- An agent needs to verify that targets are in-scope before any probing.

Do NOT use this skill when:

- The user cannot confirm written authorization for the target.
- The target is a production system without an explicit testing window.
- The request is for raw socket exploitation or destructive payload execution.

## Skill Contract (Interface)

The skill conforms to the OpenClaw Skill interface:

```ts
interface Skill {
  name: string;                 // "gkn-phantom"
  version: string;              // "5.1.0"
  description: string;
  inputSchema: object;          // see references/data_schemas.md -> InputSchema
  outputSchema: object;         // see references/data_schemas.md -> OutputSchema
  execute(ctx: AgentContext): Promise<SkillResult>;
}
```

`AgentContext` fields consumed by this skill:

| Field        | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope`      | `domains`, `ip_ranges`, `allowed_paths`, `blocked_paths`   |
| `targets`    | List of target URLs / IPs / hosts to test                   |
| `credentials`| Optional cookies / tokens for authenticated testing (L3)    |
| `config`     | `rate_limit_rps` (default 3), `safe_mode` (default true), `require_human_approval` (default true) |
| `tools`      | `runShell`, `httpRequest`, `browser`, `logger`              |
| `state`      | Persisted state-machine scratch area                        |
| `memory`     | Cross-run memory for dedup / trending                      |

## Execution State Machine

The skill MUST execute as a deterministic state machine. Transition to the next
state only after the current state's exit criteria are met. Persist
`state.current` and `state.history` in `ctx.state` so runs are resumable and
auditable.

### State-by-state procedure

1. **INIT** — Validate `inputSchema`, load config defaults, initialize
   `state`, seed `memory` from prior runs for dedup. Log the run id.

2. **SCOPE_CHECK** — Run `scripts/scope_guard.py` against every target in
   `ctx.targets`. A target is in-scope only if it matches a `scope.domains`
   entry AND an `scope.ip_ranges` entry AND its path is in
   `scope.allowed_paths` and NOT in `scope.blocked_paths`. If ANY target is
   out of scope, ABORT the entire run and return an error result listing the
   offending targets. Never proceed with partial scope.

3. **PRE_FLIGHT** (v2 NEW) — Run `scripts/safety_simulator.py` BEFORE any
   active probing. Three sub-steps:
   - **dry-run**: simulate the detection plan without network calls. Emit
     `safety_verdict` (SAFE_TO_PROCEED / REQUIRES_HUMAN_APPROVAL / CAUTION).
     If verdict is REQUIRES_HUMAN_APPROVAL and `config.require_human_approval`
     is true, pause for approval before proceeding.
   - **target risk scoring**: score each target 0–100 based on environment,
     open ports, sensitive paths, and risky technologies. Targets scoring ≥80
     are marked `require_approval`.
   - **automatic scope narrowing**: if any target is critical-risk, augment
     `scope.blocked_paths` with dangerous paths (`/admin/delete`,
     `/actuator/shutdown`, etc.) to reduce blast radius.
   - Output: `pre_flight_report` with verdict, risk scores, narrowed scope.

4. **PASSIVE_RECON** (v4 NEW, L1 — zero-touch) — Run `scripts/passive_recon.py`
   for each target domain. Collect intelligence without sending a single packet
   to the target:
   - **Certificate Transparency (crt.sh)**: enumerate subdomains from TLS certs.
   - **DNS enumeration**: A/AAAA/CNAME/MX/NS/TXT/SOA records via built-in DNS
     client (pure Python, no external deps).
   - **WHOIS lookup**: registrar, dates, name servers via IANA referral chain.
   - **Technology stack detection**: analyze HTTP headers + HTML body for
     server/framework/CMS/CDN/JS library signatures.
   - **Wayback Machine**: discover historical URLs from archive.org.
   - **GitHub dorking**: generate search queries for exposed secrets/configs.
   - **Email pattern enumeration**: discover organizational email formats.
   - Output: `passive_recon_result` with subdomains, dns_records, whois,
     technologies, wayback_urls, github_dorks, emails.
   This phase is entirely passive — no packets sent to the target.

5. **ACTIVE_RECON** (v4 EXPANDED, L1–L2) — Active asset discovery:
   - **Port scanning** (nmap): `nmap -sT --top-ports 100` or equivalent.
     Auto-detects naabu for faster scanning if available.
     Only in-scope IPs; respect rate limit.
   - **SSL/TLS analysis** (v4 NEW): Run `scripts/ssl_analyzer.py` on each
     HTTPS target. Certificate chain analysis, cipher suite grading (A+–F),
     protocol version detection (SSLv2–TLS 1.3), vulnerability checks
     (POODLE/BEAST/CRIME/FREAK/Logjam/DROWN/Heartbleed), HSTS analysis.
   - **Technology fingerprinting** (v4 NEW): Run `scripts/tech_fingerprint.py`
     for deep tech stack detection: 30+ server patterns, 17 language/framework
     patterns, 26 meta generator tags, 19 favicon hashes, 20 error page
     signatures, 25 CDN/WAF header patterns, 12 database error patterns.
     Auto-detects httpx and uses it if available for faster probing.
   - **Directory fuzzing** (v4 NEW): Run `scripts/directory_fuzzer.py` with
     10 curated wordlist categories (116 paths: general/admin/backup/api/
     config/upload/logs/exposed/shell/backend_tech) + 20 extensions.
     Custom 404 page detection, recursive discovery, technology-aware
     prioritization. Auto-detects ffuf and uses it if available.
   - **HTTP fingerprinting** (headers, server, technologies) via `httpRequest`.
   - **Endpoint discovery** (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, common wordlists).
   - Output: expanded `assets` object `{ domains, ips, endpoints, ssl_report,
     tech_stack, discovered_dirs }`.

6. **AUTH_SETUP** (optional, L3) — Only when `ctx.credentials` is non-empty and
   the user explicitly enabled authenticated testing. Supported methods:
   cookie injection, bearer token injection, browser-driven login session,
   session persistence into `ctx.state.session_ref`. After setup, verify the
   session is authenticated by hitting an identity endpoint; record
   `authenticated: true/false`.

7. **ACTIVE_TESTING** (L2–L3, L4 requires human approval) — Run the
   Vulnerability Engine via `scripts/vuln_detector.py`, which generates a
   severity-tiered detection plan from the recon assets. Execute the plan
   tier-by-tier (low → medium → high → critical), routing every probe through
   `scope_guard` + `rate_limiter`. The detection tiers and their types are
   defined in `references/payload_playbook.md` and `references/advanced_payload_playbook.md` (v3 NEW), and baselined in
   `references/data_schemas.md` (type→severity table):

   - **LOW** — `info_leak`, `open_redirect`, `csrf` (weak/missing token),
     `misconfig` (security headers / verbose banners),
     `component_exposure` (Actuator/Druid/Swagger/UEditor 未授权访问检测),
     `graphql_introspection` (v3 NEW: GraphQL schema disclosure),
     `directory_listing` (v3 NEW: directory listing exposure).
     Non-destructive, L1–L2.
   - **MEDIUM** — `xss` (reflected), `path_traversal` (read-only),
     `xxe` (OOB to authorized sink only), `ssti` (arithmetic reflection),
     `deserialization` (innocuous + malformed probe, NO gadget chains),
     `command_injection` (time-based only, capped),
     `weak_credential` (弱口令/默认凭据，bounded set，来源152份真实SRC报告),
     `captcha_bypass` (验证码绕过：空值/删除/万能码/复用/返回包篡改),
     `crlf_injection` (v3 NEW: CRLF / HTTP response splitting),
     `cors_misconfig` (v3 NEW: CORS misconfiguration),
     `subdomain_takeover` (v3 NEW: dangling DNS takeover),
     `host_header_injection` (v3 NEW: host header poisoning),
     `websocket_hijacking` (v3 NEW: CSWSH),
     `session_fixation` (v3 NEW: session fixation),
     `email_injection` (v3 NEW: email header injection). L2–L3.
   - **HIGH** — `xss` (stored, cross-user), `sqli` (error/boolean/capped
     time-based), `ssrf` (L4, blocked in safe_mode), `idor` (L3 differential,
     含批量ID遍历),
     `file_upload` (文件上传检测：扩展名绕过/Content-Type/UEditor/双后缀，无真实webshell),
     `logic_flaw` (逻辑缺陷：返回包篡改/价格篡改/步骤跳过/短信轰炸/重放),
     `nosql_injection` (v3 NEW: MongoDB/NoSQL injection),
     `ldap_injection` (v3 NEW: LDAP injection),
     `graphql_injection` (v3 NEW: GraphQL batching/DOS/injection),
     `cache_poisoning` (v3 NEW: web cache poisoning),
     `race_condition` (v3 NEW: TOCTOU / race condition),
     `prototype_pollution` (v3 NEW: client/server prototype pollution),
     `jwt_deep_analysis` (v3 NEW: extended JWT attacks),
     `oauth_misconfig` (v3 NEW: OAuth flow misconfig),
     `mass_assignment` (v3 NEW: auto-binding / mass assignment),
     `dependency_confusion` (v3 NEW: supply chain dependency confusion).
   - **CRITICAL** — `rce` (L4, second independent probe, no exfil, blocked in
     safe_mode), `auth_bypass` (default-cred / JWT alg:none / reset-token
     predictability), `priv_esc` (vertical, role-claim flip),
     `data_exposure` (PII regex thresholds — UPGRADES an existing validated
     finding to critical), `http_smuggling` (v3 NEW: HTTP request smuggling).

   Methods: tool-based scanning (nuclei-like templates via `runShell`),
   heuristic probing via `httpRequest`, LLM-assisted reasoning (safe mode
   only) for classification and safe payload suggestion. Each candidate
   finding is emitted in the standard Finding schema with its `tier` and
   baseline `severity`; `data_exposure` is applied as a post-validation
   upgrade via `vuln_detector.classify_data_exposure()`.

   **Adaptive Engine (v3 ENHANCED)**: When a probe fails or is WAF-blocked, the
   agent invokes `scripts/adaptive_engine.py` to build an adaptive plan:
   - **retry with backoff**: transient errors (timeout, connection reset) →
     exponential backoff (500ms, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s capped).
   - **payload mutation**: WAF detected (25+ types: Cloudflare/Akamai/AWS/Imperva/
     F5/FortiWeb/Barracuda/Sucuri/Radware/ModSecurity/NAXSI/Wallarm/Wordfence/
     安全狗/云盾/腾讯云WAF/深信服/长亭雷池/启明星辰/绿盟/山石/天融信/华为云WAF/
     百度云加速/Cloudbric) → generate 5-12 mutated payload variants (encoding/
     case/comment/unicode/separator/operator bypass) for all 38 vulnerability types.
   - **WAF detection fallback**: identify WAF type from response headers/status/
     body → select type-specific bypass strategy.
   - **alternative probe strategy**: primary signal not matched → try secondary
     signals (20+ signal sets for all vuln types including NoSQL/LDAP/CRLF/SSRF/
     SSTI/XXE/GraphQL/CORS/JWT/OAuth/Smuggling/Cache/Race/Prototype/MassAssign).
   The adaptive plan is recorded in `finding.adaptive_metadata`.

   **v3/v4 Specialized Modules**: In addition to the core vulnerability detector,
   twelve specialized modules are available at ACTIVE_TESTING:
   - `scripts/js_analyzer.py` (v3, v5.4 UPGRADED) — JS static analysis: secrets
     leakage, dangerous sinks (eval/Function/innerHTML), postMessage
     misconfiguration, prototype pollution, weak crypto, debug leaks, DOM
     clobbering; plus `extract_endpoint_entries()` (v5.4) which mines hidden
     hardcoded parameterized API endpoints from bundles — fed into
     `quick_combat.probe_injection()` by the combat pipeline.
   - `scripts/cve_correlator.py` (v3) — CVE correlation: matches discovered
     technologies (nginx, Apache, Tomcat, Spring, Django, etc.) with known CVEs,
     providing CVSS severity, exploit availability, and risk scoring.
   - `scripts/advanced_injection.py` (v3) — Advanced injection engine: specialized
     detection plans for NoSQL, LDAP, CRLF, HTTP smuggling, cache poisoning,
     race conditions, extended SSTI, and XPATH injection.
   - `scripts/api_auditor.py` (v3) — API security auditor: GraphQL introspection
     depth/batching/field-suggestion tests, REST method override/content-type
     confusion, WebSocket origin validation/CSWSH detection.

   - `scripts/waf_evasion.py` (v4 NEW) — Advanced WAF bypass engine: protocol-level
     evasion, 6 encoding bypass techniques, per-vuln obfuscation (10 SQLi + 10 XSS
     + 7 traversal + 8 cmd-injection), 10 WAF-specific rule sets, HPP, content-type
     switching, all bypass variants with technique descriptions.
   - `scripts/directory_fuzzer.py` (v4 NEW) — Smart directory brute-forcing:
     10 curated wordlist categories (116 paths) + 20 extensions, custom 404
     detection via SimHash, recursive depth, tech-aware prioritization (17 stacks).

     error page, 25 CDN/WAF, 12 DB error + OS detection patterns. All
     body-scanned pattern tables run through the Aho-Corasick prefilter
     (`pattern_matcher.PrefilteredRegexSet`): one pass per response, then
     only the regexes whose required literals are present execute.

   **v5 Add-on Modules** (used at their designated states):

     classification (SAFE/CAUTION/DANGEROUS), batch generation, PoC index HTML.
     Used at REPORT_GENERATION.
   - `scripts/rules_loader.py` (v5 NEW) — YAML rule configuration engine: loads
     rules from ../rules/*.yaml, validates schema, hot-reload (mtime watch),
     exports RuleRegistry with get_rules_by_tier/type, backward compatible.
     Used at INIT.
   - `scripts/quick_combat.py` (v5.4) — Streamlined combat
     pipeline with a layered impact chain:
     (1) quick nuclei scan (scope-limited) + 7 built-in probes;
     (2) v5.2 **Impact Escalation Layer** (`escalate_severity()`): quick-probe
     findings re-graded from captured response content — live credentials
     (env-style/AWS key/private key), `.git` config disclosure, phpinfo pages,
     reachable backup archives → **high**; PII/sensitive-content score ≥ 3
     (via `vuln_detector.classify_data_exposure()`, same threshold as the
     full state machine) → **critical**. Every escalation records
     `severity_escalated_from` + `escalation_reason`;
     (3) v5.3 **Deep-Dive Adapters** (Phase 2.5, `deep_dive()`): routed by
     finding type/path — Actuator (fetch `/actuator/env` + `/configprops`,
     probe `/heapdump` presence; unmasked credentials or heapdump →
     **critical**), GraphQL (full introspection; schema + mutation surface
     exposed unauthenticated → **high**), Swagger (pull OpenAPI spec; no
     security scheme → **high**). Bounded: ≤ 3 requests/finding, 8s timeout,
     GET/POST-introspection only, zero overhead when no probe hits;
     (4) v5.3 **Parameter Discovery + Injection Probing** (Phase 2.6):
     `discover_params()` extracts same-origin URLs with query parameters
     from the entry page (links + JS strings), `probe_injection()` runs
     bounded non-destructive probes — error-based SQLi (3 generic payloads
     matched against all 6 DB engine error signatures from
     `advanced_sqli.DB_FINGERPRINT`) and SSTI arithmetic reflection
     (4 payload variants with baseline differential) — emitting high-severity
     sqli/ssti findings. Cap: 10 param URLs, 5 probed params per target;
     (5) v5.4 **CN Component Probes** (Phase 2.55, `cn_probes.py`): domestic
     OA/component unauthorized-access library (32 probes) — 泛微 e-cology
     (BeanShell servlet, Ssologin.jsp, /services/), 致远 seeyon
     (getSessionList, htmlofficeservlet, wpsAssistServlet), 通达 OA
     (/ispirit/, /module/), 用友 NC (~ic servlets, uapws), 禅道, JeecgBoot
     (jmreport `queryFieldBySql` one-shot SQLi verifier via POST →
     **critical**), 若依 (druid prod-api/dev-api, /system/), 帆软, 亿邮,
     金蝶, 蓝凌, 红帆, 万户. Probes support severity overrides, POST
     one-shot verifiers and `not_patterns` soft-404 blacklists;
     (6) v5.4 **katana Full-Site Crawl** (C3): when the katana binary is in
     PATH, `crawl_katana()` crawls the whole site (depth 3, JSONL) — every
     parameterized URL found anywhere feeds `probe_injection`, so SQLi/SSTi
     coverage goes from "entry page params" to "the whole site". No katana →
     silent fallback to entry-page-only discovery;
     (7) v5.4 **JS Bundle Mining** (C4, `js_analyzer.py`): crawled + entry-page
     JS bundles are analyzed (leaked secrets, dangerous sinks, debug
     endpoints) AND mined for hidden hardcoded endpoints
     (`extract_endpoint_entries()`) which feed back into parameter
     injection probing — JS recon chains into active probing;
     (8) v5.4 **Real OOB Channel** (C5, `oob_client.py`): replaces the
     static `oob.authorized.test` placeholder with a pollable channel —
     interactsh-client binary (self-hosted or oast.fun), ceye.io API, or
     dnslog.cn. Open-redirect probes inject the live callback domain, and
     `probe_blind_ssrf()` fires OOB-tagged callbacks into `url`-style
     params; a confirmed callback emits a **validated** (not "detected")
     blind-SSRF finding — OOB verification unlocks the validated tier for
     blind vulnerability classes;
     (9) v5.4 **Cross-Run Combat Memory** (C6): every run's finding
     fingerprints are persisted to `combat_memory.json`; a re-scan marks
     known findings `[已提交]` (submitted, user-flagged) / `[重复]` (repeat)
     so SRC duplicate submissions are avoided. All v5.4 layers toggleable:
     `--no-deep/--no-cn-probes/--no-crawl/--no-js/--no-memory/--oob-provider`.
     After detection: auto PoC generation and auto exploit generation,
     bundled into a timestamped combat report with HTML index. Entry point
     for Quick Combat Mode.
   - `scripts/exploit_generator.py` (v5.1 NEW) — Functional exploit script
     generator: converts VALIDATED findings only into self-contained Python
     demonstration scripts, organized by severity and type. Refuses findings
     that are not `validated`. Used after VALIDATION.


8. **VALIDATION** — Run `scripts/finding_validator.py`. For each candidate
   finding, (re)execute the PoC LIVE against the target, capture fresh
   request/response/timestamp, and classify into exactly one of three
   outcomes:
   - `validated` (TP) — the PoC succeeded in ≥2 independent live replays
     AND the detection signal differs from the baseline/control response
     (see Reproducibility Gate below) AND `safe_poc` is true.
   - `false_positive` (FP) — the signal was reproduced by the control
     request (no payload), or replays contradict the original signal.
     Discard.
   - `unverified_lead` — the finding cannot be reproduced live right now
     (target unreachable, WAF blocks every variant, requires out-of-scope
     action, or evidence is theoretical/assumed). Move to
     `unverified_leads[]`. NEVER report it as a finding.
   A candidate that cannot pass live replay is NOT a vulnerability — it is
   a lead. Findings promoted on the basis of code reading, version
   inference, scanner output, or LLM reasoning ALONE are forbidden in the
   final report. LLM may assist classification but cannot override evidence.

   **Confidence Scoring (v2 NEW)**: Run `scripts/confidence_scoring.py` on
   each finding. Computes a multi-factor confidence score (0.0–1.0):
   - `evidence_strength` (weight 0.30): completeness of evidence fields
   - `reproducibility_score` (weight 0.30): fraction of replays that matched
   - `signal_clarity` (weight 0.25): how unambiguous the detection signal is
   - `corroboration` (weight 0.15): multiple signals/tools/WAF-bypass agree
   A finding is promoted to `validated` only when `confidence >= 0.80`.
   The breakdown is stored in `finding.confidence_breakdown`.

   **Heuristic Decision Layer (v2.2 REPLACES probabilistic v2.1)**:
   `scripts/decision_engine.py` provides deterministic, explainable
   decisions at key decision points (OPTIONAL PLUGIN — core pipeline
   works without it):
   - **probe continuation**: 5 heuristic rules (A-E) evaluated in order:
     budget exhausted → STOP, low yield early → STOP, discovery_yield ≥ 5% →
     CONTINUE, early stage with budget → CONTINUE, otherwise → STOP.
     All decisions carry a `rule_path` for full auditability.
   - **severity upgrade**: additive scoring (+3.0 PII, +2.5 cross-user,
     +2.0 corroboration, +1.5 reproducibility); upgrade if score ≥ 2.5.
     Deterministic — same finding always yields the same decision.
   - **scope expansion**: 5 sequential gates (Gate1–Gate5) — production
     blocked, risk too high blocked, low chain potential, no findings,
     propose expansion. No probability thresholds, pure rule gating.
   - **heuristic confidence**: deterministic weighted scoring replacing
     the v2.1 Bayesian posterior. Same four factors, additive sum.
   See `references/formal_algorithms.md §5` for the explainable rule
   definitions.

9. **ATTACK_PATH_ANALYSIS** — Run `scripts/attack_path.py`. Combine multiple
   validated findings into chains (v3: 20+ attack chain patterns). Emit a graph
   `{ nodes, edges }` where nodes are findings/assets and edges represent
   exploit relationships. LLM may infer candidate edges; only edges confirmed
   by evidence are marked `confirmed`. New v3 chains include: SSRF→cloud
   metadata, SQLi→credential dumping, IDOR→mass PII exposure, SSTI→RCE,
   XSS→session hijacking, CORS→CSRF→account takeover, cache poisoning→mass
   XSS, prototype pollution→privilege escalation, HTTP smuggling→cache
   poisoning/auth bypass, NoSQL→auth bypass→data exposure, JWT→IDOR, OAuth→
   account takeover, race condition→financial fraud, CRLF→XSS, mass assignment
   →privilege escalation, subdomain takeover→phishing, LDAP→directory
   enumeration, GraphQL→data exposure, XXE→SSRF, deserialization→RCE, and
   more.

10. **REPORT_GENERATION** — Run `scripts/report_generator.py`. Produce:
   - Executive summary (human readable).
   - Technical findings table.
   - Risk score 0–100 (CVSS-like aggregate; see
     `references/safety_policy.md`).
   - Remediation steps per finding.
   - Reproduction steps per finding.
   - CI-friendly SARIF-like JSON (`results` array).
   - Full execution log from `state.history`.

11. **DONE** — Return `SkillResult` matching `outputSchema`. Persist `state`
   and `memory`. Emit final JSON (see `references/data_schemas.md` ->
   FinalOutput).

### Execution State Recovery (v2.1 NEW)

At ANY state transition, if the transition fails (network error, crash,
timeout), the agent invokes `scripts/state_recovery.py` to recover:

- **checkpoint retry**: re-attempt the failed transition with exponential
  backoff (500ms → 1s → 2s), up to 3 attempts. Uses
  `state_recovery.build_retry_plan()`.
- **partial state resume**: for ACTIVE_TESTING / VALIDATION, resume from
  where the run left off — already-probed endpoints are skipped. Uses
  `state_recovery.build_partial_resume_plan()` which reads
  `checkpoint.partial_results.probed_endpoints`.
- **failure rollback**: on catastrophic failure (retries exhausted), roll
  back to the previous SAFE state (INIT/SCOPE_CHECK/PRE_FLIGHT/RECONNAISSANCE)
  and re-attempt with a degraded strategy (e.g., reduced tier). Uses
  `state_recovery.execute_rollback()`. If no safe previous state exists,
  ABORT the run.
- The agent MUST call `state_recovery.save_partial_progress()` periodically
  DURING ACTIVE_TESTING so a crash doesn't lose probed-endpoint state.
  See `references/formal_algorithms.md §6` for the recovery algorithms.

## Safety Model (Mandatory)

The safety model is NON-NEGOTIABLE. See `references/safety_policy.md` for the
full spec. Summary:

- **Scope Guard** — every target, every request, every tool call is checked
  against `ctx.scope` before execution. Out-of-scope ⇒ immediate ABORT.
- **Risk Gate** — every action is classified L1–L4. L4 (destructive /
  privilege / write) REQUIRES human approval when
  `config.require_human_approval` is true (default). In `safe_mode`, L4 is
  blocked entirely.
- **Rate Limit** — default ≤ 3 req/sec with burst control. Over-limit
  requests are QUEUED, never dropped and never crash. Implemented in
  `scripts/rate_limiter.py`.
- **Evidence Requirement** — every finding MUST contain `evidence.request`,
  `evidence.response`, `evidence.timestamp`, `evidence.tool`, and a
  `reproducible` flag. Findings without complete evidence are rejected at
  VALIDATION.

## Reproducibility Gate (Mandatory)

Every finding in the final report MUST be a **reproduced vulnerability**,
never a theoretical or hypothetical one. "The version has a known CVE",
"the parameter looks injectable", "the scanner flagged it" — none of these
is a finding until the impact is demonstrated live. This gate is applied at
VALIDATION and enforced again at REPORT_GENERATION.

### Hard rules

1. **Live replay ≥ 2** — the PoC is executed against the live target at
   least twice by `finding_validator.py`; both replays must reproduce the
   detection signal. One-shot successes do not count.
2. **Baseline / control comparison** — a control request (same endpoint,
   benign or no payload) MUST be captured. The finding is valid only if the
   payload response differs from the control in the expected way (error,
   timing delta, content delta, status change). If the control already
   produces the "signal", the finding is a false positive.
3. **Demonstrated impact, not inferred impact** — each finding must name
   the concrete impact actually observed (data read, file read, delay
   measured, token/session obtained, action performed). Inferring impact
   the target *could* have is forbidden.
4. **Fresh evidence per report** — the request/response pair in
   `evidence` must come from a replay executed during THIS run, not copied
   from a scanner export or a previous session.
5. **Quarantine of unverified candidates** — anything that cannot pass
   rules 1–4 is moved to `unverified_leads[]` with the blocking reason
   recorded. Leads are shown in the report appendix for follow-up but are
   excluded from `findings[]`, the risk score, and the executive summary.

### Banned sources of "findings"

A finding MUST NOT originate solely from:

- Version / CVE correlation without a working exploit path on THIS target
  (cve_correlator output is recon input, not evidence).
- Scanner (nuclei et al.) matches without a successful live replay.
- Source-code reading or LLM reasoning without a live request/response.
- Generic best-practice gaps (missing headers etc.) reported beyond their
  actual demonstrated effect.

### Verification method library

Choose the strongest technique the vulnerability class allows:

| Technique | Use for | Proof standard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Echo / reflection | RCE, SSTI, XSS, SQLi (error/UNION), path traversal | Payload-controlled value appears in response (arithmetic result, file content, DB banner) |
| Differential (boolean) | Blind SQLi, IDOR, auth bypass | True/False conditions produce measurably different responses across ≥2 replays each |
| Time-based | Blind SQLi, command injection | Response delay ≈ requested sleep, confirmed twice, and control request is fast |
| Out-of-band | SSRF, XXE, blind RCE | DNS/HTTP callback received at an authorized OOB sink tied to a unique per-finding token |
| State change | Stored XSS, CSRF, logic flaws, file upload | Second request confirms the persisted effect (stored content served back, uploaded file reachable, order/balance changed) |
| Session / token proof | Auth bypass, priv-esc, session fixation | A protected resource is actually returned with the forged/fixated/predicted credential |

### Report-facing consequence

For every `validated` finding, the report MUST include: minimal repro
steps, the exact payload, the control-vs-payload evidence pair, replay
count, and the observed impact. If any element is missing, the finding is
downgraded to `unverified_leads[]` — no exceptions.

## LLM Usage Boundary

The LLM (this agent) is permitted ONLY for:

- Vulnerability reasoning and classification.
- Report generation and natural-language summaries.
- Attack path inference (candidate edges).
- Safe payload SUGGESTION (never execution of destructive payloads).

The LLM is FORBIDDEN from:

- Exploit chaining for real-world abuse.
- Bypassing or weakening scope logic.
- Generating or executing destructive payload plans.
- Overriding evidence-based validation.
- Declaring or describing a vulnerability as confirmed without live
  request/response evidence from the current run (see Reproducibility
  Gate). Phrasing such as "this should be exploitable" belongs in
  `unverified_leads[]`, never in findings or the executive summary.

## Tool Usage Rules

Allowed tools (from `ctx.tools`): `runShell`, `httpRequest`, `browser`,
`logger`.

Prohibited:

- Raw socket exploitation.
- Destructive payload execution by default.
- Scope bypass attempts (treated as a critical policy violation and logged).
- Uncontrolled scanning (must respect rate limit + scope).

## Output Specification

The skill MUST return a FinalOutput object (see
`references/data_schemas.md` -> FinalOutput):

```json
{
  "summary": "",
  "risk_score": 0,
  "assets": {},
  "findings": [],
  "unverified_leads": [],
  "attack_paths": [],
  "recommendations": [],
  "execution_log": []
}
```

`findings[]` contains ONLY reproducibility-gated `validated` findings.
Candidates that could not be reproduced live during this run are returned
in `unverified_leads[]` (with `blocking_reason`) and MUST NOT influence
`risk_score` or `summary`.

## Testability Requirements

The skill MUST be deterministic, reproducible, and idempotent. The
`assets/` directory contains worked examples:

- `assets/example_input.json` — a complete sample `AgentContext`.
- `assets/example_trace.json` — a step-by-step execution trace through every
  state, with intermediate artifacts.
- `assets/example_report.json` — the expected final output for the sample
  input.

When the user asks to "test", "dry-run", or "validate" the skill, replay the
example input and confirm the output structure matches
`assets/example_report.json`.
